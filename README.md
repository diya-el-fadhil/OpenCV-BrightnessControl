# OpenCV-BrightnessControl
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to adjust the brightness of images using OpenCV. The script provides a simple example of how to apply a brightness adjustment factor to an input image, effectively increasing or decreasing its overall brightness

Key Features
Simple Interface: The script provides a simple interface to adjust the brightness of images by specifying a brightness adjustment factor.
Efficient Processing: The script efficiently adjusts the brightness of images using NumPy arrays and OpenCV functions.
Customizable: The script can be easily customized to apply more complex brightness adjustment algorithms, such as using lookup tables (LUTs) for fine-grained control.

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
Run the brightness_control.py script, providing the path to the image you want to adjust and the desired brightness adjustment factor as command-line arguments.

EX : python brightness_control.py path/to/input/image.jpg 1.5
